""" The server class:
    A server instance contains a state_machine and a RAFT instance, 
    and provide RPC service to the client. 

    Workflow: 
     - The server takes client's request from RPC. 
     - The server then puts this request to a log maintained by the RAFT instance.
       RAFT will replicate this request to other serves. 
     - When a request is committed (replicated on a majority of servers),
       the RAFT instance will notify the server. 
     - Then, the server applies this request to the state_machine,
       and responds to the client.
